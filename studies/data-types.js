/**
 *          DATA TYPES: 
 *          
 *    0.    The way we use the word data can be tricky. To be precise about the word referring to information
 *          data are collections of datum. Some data is a collection of these collections. This could be
 *          considered entirely useless information though it would still be plural.

 /*    1.    Types of data, and the nuances of their differences is very important! To begin, a list of 
 *          data types: 
 *                  number 99 - numbers function mathematical ie decimal point and aritmetic operators, primitive
 *                  boolean true or false - true is greater than false, true is 1 and false is 0? primitive
 *                  string 'anything inside the quotes' - characters have number value... primitive data
 *                  array  ['information'] - complex data that holds other data, can be empty
 *                  object  { key:value } - complex data hold info in unorderlist by key:value pairs, use commas
 *                  function   function(){} - can take input, can return output, if called fx's are expressions
 *                  undefined  is undefined - signaling lack of 'pointing' to anything
 *                  null  is an object... 
 *                  Nan         
 *                  Infinity  
 *                  neg.Infinity
 *

 /*    2.    What are primitive data types? Complex?
 *          What is copy by value? When does it matter?
 *          What is copy by reference? How it differs from copy by value? 
 *          Dont forget console.log()
