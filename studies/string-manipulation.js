/**
 *          STRING MANIPULATION: 
 * 
 *            with operators, with string methods
 * 
 *     0.   Strings are a crucial part of JavaScript. Our ability to manipulate words in 
 *          any way possible will be eseential throughout website development. Spellcheck, predictive-text
 *          text upload, password chechking, etc all involve the movement of strings. Strings, like arrays
 *          have indices going from 0 - very large from left to right. We can use for loops to 
 *          take a string and loop through each of it's characters. There are critical methods to strings
 *          that allow us to find characters, splits the string up into an array and join the string from an
 *          array back into string, als strings can be upper and lower cased etc. Each letter of the alphabet 
 *          case aside is also represented as a nimber code allowing us to pass the string info in multiple
 *          ways and to compare strings in helpful way too. The + operator is always partiuclarly helpful in 
 *          concatenating strings though the + often needs ' ' around it to make legible sentences. The manipulation 
 *          of strings parallel that of arrays. Both have indexes and are accessible through bracket notation.
 *          Develops are commonly moving values between arrays and strings depending neseiccty becuse of this 
 *          simillarity.
